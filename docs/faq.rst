Frequently asked questions
==========================

The following notes answer common questions, and may be useful to you
when installing, configuring or using django-flashpolicies.


Why do I need a cross-domain policy file?
-----------------------------------------

Much like JavaScript, the Adobe Flash player by default has a
same-origin policy; a Flash player instance on one domain cannot load
data from another domain.

A cross-domain policy file allows you, as the owner of a domain, to
specify exceptions to this, allowing loading of data from another
domain (for example, if you have data hosted on a CDN).

In order to prevent security issues caused by loading data from
untrusted domains, your cross-domain policy file should permit *only*
those domains you know are trustworthy (i.e., because those domains
are under your control, and you can prevent malicious content from
being placed on them).


Why doesn't this application generate Silverlight's format?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The Microsoft Silverlight plugin has a same-origin sandbox like Flash,
and its native format for cross-domain policies is a file called
`clientaccesspolicy.xml`. However, if `clientaccesspolicy.xml` is
not found on the target domain, or otherwise returns an error,
Silverlight will fall back to requesting and obeying a Flash
`crossdomain.xml` file.

This means that a single file -- `crossdomain.xml` in the Flash
format -- suffices for both Flash and Silverlight. Additionally,
Silverlight is no longer supported in current versions of Microsoft's
own Edge browser, support for it is in the process of being
dropped/disabled in other major browsers, and Microsoft has announced
that Silverlight will reach end-of-life in 2021, meaning that the
Silverlight-only format corresponds to an already-small and shrinking,
and soon to be nonexistent, supported base.


Why are the elements in a different order each time I serialize my policy?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Internally, a :class:`~flashpolicies.policies.Policy` stores
information about permitted domains and headers in dictionaries, keyed
by domain names. The resulting XML is generated by iterating over
these dictionaries.

The order of keys emitted when iterating over a dictionary is
something which has changed multiple times in different versions of
Python. If you see inconsistent order, this is not a bug; it just
indicates the dictionary-iterating behavior of the version of Python
you're using. This also does not affect the well-formedness or
validity of the resulting XML document.


Why shouldn't I use wild-card ('*') domains in my policy?
---------------------------------------------------------

Use of wild-card entries in a policy effectively negates much of the
security gain that comes from explicitly specifying the permitted
domains. Unless you can and do vigilantly control all possible
domains/subdomains matching a wild-card entry, use of one will expose
you to the possibility of loading malicious content.
