django-flashpolicies |release|
==============================

This application provides management of Flash cross-domain policies
(which are required for Flash content to access information across
domains) for `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_-powered
sites. Cross-domain policies are represented by an XML file format,
and this application generates and serves the appropriate XML.

In many cases, the same policy file will also be understood by
Microsoft's Silverlight browser plugin, which supports the Adobe Flash
format as a fallback in the absence of a file in its own native
cross-domain policy format.

In the most common case, you'll set up one URL pattern, pointing the
URL `/crossdomain.xml` to the view
:func:`flashpolicies.views.allow_domains` and passing a list of
domains from which you want to allow access. For example, to allow
access from Flash content served from `media.example.com`, you could
place the following in the root URLconf of your Django site:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.urls import path

    from flashpolicies.views import allow_domains

    urlpatterns = [
        # ...your other URL patterns here...
        path(
            'crossdomain.xml',
            allow_domains,
            {'domains': ['media.example.com']}
        ),
    ]
