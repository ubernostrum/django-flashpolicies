Normal installation
-------------------

The preferred method of installing django-flashpolicies is via `pip`,
the standard Python package-installation tool. If you don't have
`pip`, instructions are available for `how to obtain and install it
<https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html>`_. If you're using a
supported version of Python, `pip` should have come bundled with
your installation of Python.

Once you have `pip`, type::

    pip install django-flashpolicies

If you don't have a copy of a compatible version of Django, this will
also automatically install one for you, and will install a third-party
library required by some of django-flashpolicies's validation code.

.. warning:: **Python 2**

   If you are using Python 2, you should install the latest Django
   1.11 release *before* installing django-flashpolicies. Later
   versions of Django no longer support Python 2, and installation
   will fail. To install a compatible version of Django for Python 2,
   run `pip install "Django>=1.11,<2.0"`.
