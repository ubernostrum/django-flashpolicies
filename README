This application enables simple Flash cross-domain access policies for
`Django <http://www.djangoproject.com>`_ sites. For example, the
following URL pattern is all you'd need to set up cross-domain access
for Flash files served from your media server::

    url(r'^crossdomain.xml$',
        'flashpolicies.views.simple',
        {'domains': ['media.yoursite.com']}),

Various other views are included, handling other common and
not-so-common cases, as well as utilities for generating custom
cross-domain policies.

Full documentation for all functionality is also included and
`available online
<http://docs.b-list.org/django-flashpolicies/1.4.1/>`_.
